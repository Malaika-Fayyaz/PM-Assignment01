# PRISMO

A minimal web application for comparing and exploring project management standards â€” **PMBOK 7th Edition**, **PRINCE2**, and **ISO 21500/21502**.
The app provides a **Google-like interface** where users can search for topics (e.g., *Risk Management*) and view relevant sections across the three standards. Results can be filtered to show **Similarities**, **Differences**, or **Unique Points**.
